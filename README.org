* 🌱 What is Vue Garden?

Vue Garden is a complete, book-length guide to Vue.js that teaches web development through the gentle art of gardening. Instead of dry technical documentation, you'll learn Vue's concepts through natural metaphors: components become plants, props are nutrients, state management is your tool shed, and deployment is transplanting to the outdoor garden.

This isn't just a tutorial with some plant puns—it's a fully-realized book where the gardening metaphor illuminates rather than decorates, making complex concepts accessible and memorable.

* 🤖 The Story Behind This Garden

This book sprouted from a unique collaboration between human creativity and AI capability. It began with a simple prompt:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Write a book about Vue using gardening as an analogy throughout... The book should be fun to read, and you should not have to be a gardener to enjoy it. Make a plan that will teach Vue gently, like a baby garden starting to grow."
#+END_QUOTE

From that seed, an entire book grew in a single conversation—demonstrating both the power of extended metaphor in technical education and the potential of AI-human collaboration in creative technical writing.

* 📖 Sample: A Taste of the Garden

Here's a small excerpt showing how the book teaches Vue concepts through gardening:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Understanding Seeds (What Are Components?)*

A component is like a seed packet. Inside that packet is everything needed to grow a particular plant: the genetic code (template), the growth instructions (logic), and the appearance details (styles).

When you buy tomato seeds, the packet contains:
- The seeds themselves (the template/structure)
- Growing instructions (the logic/behavior)  
- A picture of what they'll become (the styles/appearance)

A Vue component packages information the same way...
#+END_QUOTE
