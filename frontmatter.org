* Dedication

To all the digital gardeners who tend their code with patience and care,
who know that the best applications, like the best gardens, grow not
from haste but from understanding.

And to those just picking up their first digital trowel—
may your Vue gardens flourish.

* Acknowledgments

Like any garden, this book flourished thanks to many hands:

- The Vue.js core team, who created the fertile framework we build upon.
- The open-source community, whose shared knowledge enriches our soil like compost.
- Every developer who asked "but why?" and helped us dig deeper.
- You, dear reader, for choosing to begin this journey.
